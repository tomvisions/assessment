# Assessment Code for BNO Opportunity

Exercise: The Application Engineering team has been developing a custom WooCommerce-based product which will need to be deployed for this initiative. As a member of the DevOps Engineering team your job will be to create the cloud-based infrastructure for supporting this deployment. You will need to create a reference architecture and implement it using modern IaC techniques with documentation for 3-tier application. You can use serverless or container technology or VMs to implement this.

Create a reference architecture and implement it using modern IAC techniques with documentation for a 3 tier application. Candidates can use serverless or container technology or VMs to implement this.

After working on this code for 1 1/2 days,, I've build about 70 pecent of the infastructure needed.

Development and testing took longer then I expected. Testing itself takes a while since it's building infastucture.

The archtecture that I went for was a Fargate architecture inside of a VPC geared for a green/blue deployment using CI/CD Pipleline



# The stacks I've build so far.

## VPCStack
This stack builds the VPC for the Fargate docker container - VPC ID is stored in SSM paramated since it's not possible to read an output of it for other stacks.

## ECSClusterStack
This stack builds the ECS Cluster and Security Group. Both Cluster Name and Security Group Id are placed as Outputs

## ECSServiceStack
This stack builds the ECS Service, as well as Task Definition and adds the container for what wordpress with  WooCommerce plugin will reside on. Still working on the Target Groups

# MySQLStack
This stack builds a MySQL instance in the RDS Service

What there 











This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `npx cdk deploy`  deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `npx cdk diff`    compare deployed stack with current state
* `npx cdk synth`   emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
